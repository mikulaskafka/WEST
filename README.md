# WEST-Restaurant-Bar-Landing-Page
As part of my assignment at coding bootcamp, I've created a landing page for a fictional client an upscale WEST Restaurant &amp; Bar. 


Design, develop and deploy the landing page.

Create the 3 necessary links to the landing page with the appropriate UTM-parameters for each of the three platforms/channels.

Draft the copies for the three platforms (since this is typically not the job of a marketing analytics professional, consider using chatGPT or harpa.ai).

BONUS: Also suggest visuals for each post and the email.

Create a new account within your GTM account and implement the container on the landing page.

Create and set up a consent screen with consentmanager, respecting the rules of GDPR, the Irish national law derived from the ePrivacy Directive (Regulation 5 of the ePrivacy Regulations – “the ePrivacy Regulations”) as well as the restaurant’s corporate design
