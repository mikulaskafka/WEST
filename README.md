# WEST-Restaurant-Bar-Landing-Page
As part of my assignment at marketing analytics bootcamp, I've created a landing page for a fictional client - an upscale WEST Restaurant &amp; Bar. 

I implemented GTM (Google Tag Manager) and set up a consent screen with consentmanager, respecting the rules of GDPR, the Irish national law derived from the ePrivacy Directive (Regulation 5 of the ePrivacy Regulations – “the ePrivacy Regulations”) as well as the restaurant’s corporate design.

I also created and set up a Google Analytics property and created tracking tags via GTM on coupon downloads, nav clicks, and form reservation.

The task was to launch the campaign on Instagram, Facebook and in an email newsletter. I have created separate UTM campaign links for accurate tracking:

Instagram: https://olgashulezhko.github.io/WEST/?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=discount_coupon 
Facebook: https://olgashulezhko.github.io/WEST/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=discount_coupon
Email: https://olgashulezhko.github.io/WEST/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=discount_coupon
